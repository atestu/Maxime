Maxime
============

Maxime is a way to show off your Flickr photos with a custom design. I made it for [my brother's website](http://maximetestu.com/).

You need to be a programmer to use it as the code is, errâ€¦ "quick and dirty." It's really simple to understand and to modify to suit your needs though. As you can see the number of lines is extremely low. Fork it baby!
